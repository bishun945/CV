### Currently searching for a PD position

My current interest is to build an algorithm blending framework for estimating optical active constitutes, such as Chlorophyll-a concentration, across Case I and II waters from remote sensing data. I am also interested in building Chla algorithms for specific water types (e.g., turbid Case II waters), column-integrated algal biomass for inland lakes, atmospheric correction, and data gap-filling for satellite imagery.
