Hi guys,

This is the repo used to generate/render my resume from Rmd files. I hope all the information provided here makes you know more about me and welcome to contact me if you feel interested in my research work.

Feel free to fork/modify this repo (excluding photos and images with extensions \*.jpg and \*.png) and regenerate a resume based on your own information. Again, any issue when building your resume is welcome to me.

Shun
